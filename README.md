# Soil Mass Balance Data from Bergstrom et al. 2019.
A new SPC-based example dataset called (bergstrom2019)[https://github.com/ncss-tech/aqp/issues/298]  Soil and Landscape Constituent mass balance data for Fraser Experimental Forest to develop and test new methods for working with strain calculations and novel vizualizations. Data are an expanded datset used in (Bergstrom et al, 2018)[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016706117314738] to 1) determine whether landscape position along catenas imparts a control on the distribution and sourcing of soil cations in the FEF and 2) evaluate the contribution of atmospherically-derived Ca to the soil cation pool in FEF soils.


## Overview
The FEF, Grand County, Colorado, USA, is located in the central Rocky Mountains (Fig. 1). Research in the fields of hydrology and forest dynamics has taken place in the FEF since 1937. 


## Geochemical (constituent) Mass Balance
The geochemical (constituent) mass balance approach is used to estimate weathering by calculating volume changes through a soil profile and parent material composition. This approach uses Strain (ε), a measure of soil volume change incurred during pedogenesis, and was calculated as follows: ([Brimhall and Dietrich, 1987](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0016703787900706); [Chadwick et al., 1990](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0169555X9090012F); and [Brimhall et al., 1992](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.255.5045.695)
