# Introduction

This is an introduction to the soil constituent mass balance approach and calculations. The geochemical (constituent) mass balance approach is used to quantify soil weathering by calculating volume changes through the soil profile. The approach is based on conservation of mass and provides a functional relationship among soil chemical composition, bulk density, and volume change in relation to the soil's parent material. 

Mass balance functions quantify the soil's strain (ε), mass transfer (τ), and mass flux into and out of soil horizons.  Strain is unitless and calculated as the sum of the depth-weighted contributions from each weathered soil horizon in its respective pedon. The mass transfer coefficient (τ) is used to evaluate element mobility within the soil, and mass flux is used to evaluate mobility within the landscape. 

More information on the approach and calculations are from [Chadwick and others (1990)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0169-555X(90)90012-F), [Egli and Fitze (2000)](https://journals.lww.com/soilsci/Fulltext/2000/05000/Formulation_of_Pedologic_Mass_Balance_Based_on.8.aspx), [Vaughan and others (2018)](https://doi.org/10.2136/sssaj2018.02.0071) and [Bergstrom and others (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.07.024).

#  Fraser Experimental Forest

This demo uses soil data from the Fraser Experimental Forest (FEF), Grand County, Colorado, USA, located in the central Rocky Mountains to demonstrate the mass balance approach. Soils were sampled from 2012-2013 along mountain landscape positions (1=summit, 2=shoulder, 3=backslope, and 4=footslope) of upper and lower watersheds (BL, BU, EL, EU, FL, FU, IL, and IU) in the Fraser Experiemtal Forest. Data includes morphologic, elemental, and physical data by horizon as well as site data. (Figure 1.)

Figure 1. Fraser Experimental Forest soil locations. Soils were sampled in 2013 along mountain landscape positions (1=summit, 2=shoulder, 3=backslope, and 4=footslope) of upper and lower watersheds (BL, BU, EL, EU, FL, FU, IL, and IU). Data includes morphologic, elemental, and physical data by horizon as well as site data. 

To gain insight into the generation and distribution of the soil cation pool, mass balance analysis was used on soil geochemical data to pedons across eight soil catenas in complex mountain terrain typical of the central Rocky Mountains. They found that mass gains are primarily attributable to pedogenic additions of Ca to the soil mantle via atmospheric dust, and that soil catenas on the summit landscapes were most enriched in Ca. 

We use aqp, which gives us the basic data structure for pedon data, the SoilProfileCollection object. Install the following packages from CRAN, and load into the current R session.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(aqp)
```

One of the example datasets is bergstrom2019. Load bergstrom2019.

```{r}
h <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/aqp/master/misc/example-data/bergstrom2019/horizon-data.csv')
s <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ncss-tech/aqp/master/misc/example-data/bergstrom2019/site-data.csv')

h$hzID <- NULL
s$id <- NULL
colnames(h)[1] <- "pedon" 

depths(h) <- pedon ~ top + bottom
site(h) <- s
hzdesgnname(h) <- 'name'
```

Explore soil groupings.
```{r}
# Groups
h$group <- factor(substr(profile_id(h), 0, 2))

# Plots
par(mar = c(0, 0, 3, 2))
plotSPC(trunc(h, 0, 100), color = 'pH', id.style = 'top', width = 0.33, name.style = 'center-center')
groupedProfilePlot(trunc(h, 0, 100), groups = 'group', color = 'pH', id.style = 'top', width = 0.33, 
                   name.style = 'center-center', group.name.offset = -15)
```


# Mass Balance 

Mass balance functions quantify strain (ε), mass transfer (τ), and mass flux into and out of soil horizons. More information on the approach test dataset are at [Bergstrom and others (2019)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2018.07.024).

## Strain

Strain (ε), or volume change, is estimated by the ratio of volume change during weathering with respect to the volume of the initial parent material. It is calculated to determine the amount or sense of deformation in soils using an assumed isovolume frame of reference, such as an insoluble host mineral of immobile element (usually Titanium or Zirconium). Positive strains infer dilation and negative strains represent collapse. Strain (ε i,w) is defined as:

$$ ε_{i.ws} =  \frac{ρ_{pm} C_{i,pm}}{ρ_{ws} C_{i,ws}} - 1 $$

where ρ is soil bulk density, Ci is the concentration of an (i) immobile reference element in the (ws) weathered soil horizon or the p the (pm) soil parent material. 

The following function can be used to compute volumetric strain for soil horizons based on immobile reference on soil data where the lowest horizon for each pedon is considered the parent material of the soil:

```{r}
Strain <- function(x, bulkdensity, iref) { 
  x$pm.i <- profileApply(x, FUN= function(x)
    {tail(x[[bulkdensity]], 1) * tail(x[[iref]], 1) })
  x.strain <- profileApply(x, FUN= function(x) 
    { (x$pm.i) / (x[[bulkdensity]] * x[[iref]] ) -1  } )
  print(c(x.strain, use.names =F))
}
```

Now calculate the elemental strain using Titanium (Ti) as the immobile reference. Note that the lowest depth for each pedon is has a zero volume change.

```{r, results='hide'}
h$Ti_strain <- Strain(h, "BD","Ti_ppm")
#
groupedProfilePlot(trunc(h, 0, 100), groups = 'group', color = 'Ti_strain', id.style = 'top', width = 0.33, 
                   name.style = 'center-center', group.name.offset = -15)
```

## Mass Transfer 

Mass Transfer is the horizon's element mobility in the soil per mass fraction of the parent material. The open-system Mass Transfer Coefficient for the element j (τj,w) is defined as: 

$$ τ_{j.ws} =  \left(\frac{ρ_{ws} C_{j,ws}}{ρ_{pm} C_{j,pm}} (ε_{i.ws}+ 1)\right) - 1 $$

where ρ is soil bulk density. Cj,w is the concentration of a mobile chemical element j of the the weathered soil horizon w, Cj,p is the concentration of a mobile chemical element j of the parent material p, ε j,w is the strain, or the volumetric changes estimated by the ratio of volume change during weathering with respect tot he volume of the initial material. 

The following function can be used to compute mass transfer for soil horizons based on immobile reference on soil data and where the lowest horizon for each pedon is considered the parent material of the soil:

```{r}
MassTransfer <- function(x, Strain, bulkdensity, mobile) { 
  x$pm.i <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) {
    tail(x[[bulkdensity]], 1) * tail(x[[mobile]], 1) })
  x.MassT <-profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) { 
    (x[[bulkdensity]] * x[[mobile]] / x$pm.i) * (x[[Strain]] + 1) - 1})
  print(c(x.MassT, use.names =F))
}
```


Now calculate the mass transfer of the mobile cation Calcium (ca) using Titanium (Ti) as the index, or immobile reference. 

```{r, results='hide'}
h$tau_Ca.n <- MassTransfer(h, "Ti_strain", "BD", "Ca_ppm")
#
groupedProfilePlot(trunc(h, 0, 100), groups = 'group', color = 'tau_Ca.n', id.style = 'top', width = 0.33, 
                   name.style = 'center-center', group.name.offset = -15)
```



## Mass Flux

Mass flux values estimate elemental gain or loss of a mobile element from the soil profile. The weathering mass flux co

$$ mass_{j,flux} = ρ_{p} ∆Z_{w} \frac{1}{ε_{i.w}+ 1} C_{j,p}τ_{j,w} $$ 

where ρ is bulk density, w is the weathered soil horizon, p is parent material, and Cj,p is the concentration of element j, τj,w is the open-system mass transport function for the element j, and z is the thickness of the soil horizons (from Egli etal 2000). The mass fluxes from horizons contributing to a soil profile were summed to obtain a weathering mass flux for the entire soil profile.

The following function can be used to compute mass flux for soil horizons based on immobile reference on soil data and where the lowest horizon for each pedon is considered the parent material of the soil:


```{r}

MassFlux <- function(x, Strain, MassFlux, bulkdensity, mobile) { 
  x@horizons$hz.z <- x[[x@depthcols[2] ]] - x[[x@depthcols[1] ]] 
  x@site$s.z <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) {tail(x[[x@depthcols[1]]], 1)}) 
  x@horizons$hz.p <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) { x$hz.z / x$s.z })
  x@horizons$flux <- x@horizons$hz.p * x@horizons[[MassFlux]]
  x$flux
}  

```

Now calculate the horizon Ca mass flux, using Strain() calculation with Ti as the immobile reference

```{r, results='hide'}

h$Ca_mf <- MassFlux(h, "Ti_strain", "tau_Ca.n", "BD", "Ca_ppm")
#
groupedProfilePlot(trunc(h, 0, 100), groups = 'group', color = 'Ca_mf', id.style = 'top', width = 0.33, 
                   name.style = 'center-center', group.name.offset = -15)

```

The following function can be used to compute mass flux for soil pedons based on immobile reference on soil data and where the lowest horizon for each pedon is considered the parent material of the soil:

```{r}
MassFluxP <- function(x, Strain, MassFlux, bulkdensity, mobile) { 
  x@horizons$hz.z <- x[[x@depthcols[2] ]] - x[[x@depthcols[1] ]] 
  x@site$s.z <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) {tail(x[[x@depthcols[1]]], 1)}) 
  x@horizons$hz.p <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) { x$hz.z / x$s.z }) 
  x@horizons$flux <- x@horizons$hz.p * x@horizons[[MassFlux]]
  x$pflux <- profileApply(x, FUN = function(x) { sum(x$flux)})
  x$pflux
}  

```

now calculate pedon mass flux. 

```{r, results='hide'}
h@site$Ca_SiteMF <- MassFluxP(h, "Ti_strain", "tau_Ca.n", "BD", "Ca_ppm")
```

```

```

Mass flux

```{r}

```


# Immobile Reference

Titanium (Ti) and Zirconium (Zr) are typically used as immobile reference elements due to their stability within their host mineral phases and resistance against dissolution. Ti often remains enriched in the fine fraction and Zr enriched in the coarse silt fraction of the particle size distribution.

Todo: Develop test. Regress the relationship between their mass transfer function values against percent clay and sand (Ti to Zr, and to texture).

Also: An enrichment factor is used to test the mobility of elements and
